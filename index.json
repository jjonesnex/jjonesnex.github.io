[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI was halfway through my bag of HEB Cheese Crunchies when it occurred to me that Technical Support, or any other customer service function, really, is enough to make the average person a bit crazy, and possibly functionally insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CEO is supposed to be the guy running the company, but even if the server that went down is a thousand miles away, it will eventually become \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e fault, and the person on the other end of the phone is gonna let you know about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, it\u0026rsquo;s the heat of passion, and passion makes people stupid in some cases. There\u0026rsquo;s a high level of panic in watching your website crumple and blow away like a gum wrapper in the wind, or your cable television display the mind-numbing white noise of static in the last period of your favorite game, even that time when the brand new hair dryer you bought to tame that unwieldy mane of yours emitted a slight happy gust, then exited stage left to that happy hippie commune in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis gets taken out on your local support person because someone must be tied to a pole in the village square and caned naked in public for this crime of inconvenience, and they are the first in line. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of being in the wrong job at the wrong time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the support person, it starts with a glass of wine after work. Then it graduates to beer with the boys, who can share the pain of the morale beatings. It\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of time before they are naked on the back stoop, brain fogged from self induced waterboarding with a bottle of Smirnoff and a cop asking for their ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I artfully removed the sacred orange-gold dust of the heavens from my fingertips and closed the bag with a restraint only found at AA meetings, it registered that there are eight specific actions the general consuming public can put in place today to prevent the slow-speed depressed streakers of tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us take this journey:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"1-take-the-ticket\"\u003e1) Take The Ticket\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want your thing solved, and you want it solved immediately. You know what thing. \u003cem\u003eThe thing.\u003c/em\u003e There\u0026rsquo;s a temptation to do it without all of the paperwork and what seems to be a whole lot of red tape. I understand.

I also understand your frustration and the feeling that you got caught up in something you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they want to \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; you to a ticket.

When you spend that half hour in conversation with Don, or Jacob, or Akil, Rahesh, whoever, they\u0026rsquo;re going to go off shift eventually. We don\u0026rsquo;t live in a workstation, that\u0026rsquo;s just where you meet us. There are kids to feed and put to sleep, landlords to calm down, painful commutes to be had. They have the same problems to deal with off work that you have, or at least some subset thereof. Your half hour will drift away in the wind. As well as the fact that you ever existed in the support world at all, or your problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else will know. And because we\u0026rsquo;re humans, helpful or not, our brains will evict those random phone calls like an overloaded Redis evicts keypairs. Because the other team members don\u0026rsquo;t know, \u003cem\u003eno one will care.\u003c/em\u003e It\u0026rsquo;s nothing personal or malicious, just that there\u0026rsquo;s no record of it. Because you fought against getting your problem down in writing, that problem never existed at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTickets are your friend. Having them makes you \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e friend, because then we can help take care of this thorn in your side. And we\u0026rsquo;ll keep at it until some kind of solution is reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a friend would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-dont-be-a-diva\"\u003e2) Don\u0026rsquo;t Be A Diva\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes paying for and using a service makes you feel like the only one in the room.

Honestly, I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen a lot of that, but I have seen it before. It falls into two camps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;I pay good money!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we know you do. That\u0026rsquo;s why we want to get you out of your rut as quickly as possible. What you\u0026rsquo;re forgetting in the moment is that everybody\u0026rsquo;s money is good, and they expect the same level of service that we aim to provide as support professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don\u0026rsquo;t like that you\u0026rsquo;re down. A problem is a problem is a problem. Which means it\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e problem. And those problems keep us away from the things we like to do. In my case, this usually involves ways to make my diagnostic process quicker, more streamlined, and informative. That trickles down to value for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many cases, the problem that affects you is affecting other people, and all of us are having a momentary, collective sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of us like sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, \u003cem\u003emost\u003c/em\u003e of us don\u0026rsquo;t like sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you know who I work for?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do. And don\u0026rsquo;t you know who holds your infrastructure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the military, I was taught there were three sets of people you never piss off: The cooks, the medics, and the riggers. If you piss off the cooks, you\u0026rsquo;ll be hungry and wishing rocks were edible. Piss off the medics, and good luck plugging those leaks when you need to, or getting medicine that works when you feel like three day old crud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiss off the riggers, and you\u0026rsquo;re jumping out the door into the wild blue yonder at 1200 feet above the earth with a bed sheet, and then none of it matters anymore. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll bounce. Maybe you won\u0026rsquo;t. But you certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be at Sunday dinner. I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of a case in Airborne history where that actually happened, but it\u0026rsquo;s still a good rule of thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if that line escapes your lips, realize you are the type that may give the middle finger to a road construction crew because they held you up. You may also understand the mistake when you lose your coffee to a pothole they wanted to fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are trying to solve the problems that are a pain in \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo let them solve them.

It\u0026rsquo;s a righteous anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife is too short for that type of horse hockey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should be at home, relaxing after the day of whatever nonsense you had to deal with, not juggling this. So I\u0026rsquo;m not mad at you, I\u0026rsquo;m mad at the problem. And I want it to die its ugly, burning death and go away, just like you do. We both want to go back to our usual programming of rainbows and unicorns, or at least something in that vein of ease and frivolity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake a breath. Clear your mind. Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve made that call and opened that ticket, someone, a team of someones, even, wants that problem to go away just as bad as you do. And whether you recognize it or not, you \u003cem\u003epaid\u003c/em\u003e for us to feel that way, even if we already did naturally. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time for us to do our thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s human nature to be in the sour tart position and feel like your support team doesn\u0026rsquo;t really understand, or care, or can relate to the money you\u0026rsquo;re losing. Here\u0026rsquo;s a secret you might not have known. Many of us have other, outside of the support \u0026ldquo;pay job\u0026rdquo; gigs and businesses. They\u0026rsquo;re obviously not enough to quit the support job, but they have their own moments of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, we\u0026rsquo;ve sat in your chair. Sometimes more recently than you think. So we get it. We feel it. We have skin in your game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-embrace-humanity\"\u003e4) Embrace Humanity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one is going to get bumpy, so buckle up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with technicians from many different countries. As can be expected, this hasn\u0026rsquo;t been true in \u003cem\u003eevery single case\u003c/em\u003e, but in a majority of them. From Indian, to Chinese, Russian and African, there have been a vast array of dialects and accents cross my phone lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an North American, and especially as a Texan, we have a hard enough time understanding \u003cem\u003eeach other\u003c/em\u003e, much less outside of the country, and when our closest cousins are the Australians, it gets \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e magical. They have a hard time finding the letter \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; at a railroad. Like Boston, but with less good hockey. I can\u0026rsquo;t say too much, as I was raised in the American South, and we tend to speak so slowly and with such a thick drawl that we can freshly pave new roads with each sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;re heavy on metaphors and euphemisms, and this appears to provide the rest of the world with a steady source of migraines. I\u0026rsquo;ve had perfectly good jokes fall as flat as a pancake because the person I was communicating with thought I was being literal, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t cognizant of how it registered with the listener in the slightest. Explaining a joke is the tenth circle of Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand when some customers demand to speak with an \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; support tech that can \u0026ldquo;speak the English\u0026rdquo;. But I also get irritated when the person they are passing up is a hardcore subject matter expert in a specific topic, and has forgotten more than the American \u0026ldquo;good speaky English\u0026rdquo; tech will ever know. If you cannot speak over the phone with the support tech you have, I beseech you, feel them out and go to ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp them help you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have software to assist with that, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss some of the gold that\u0026rsquo;s out there. Some of the best techs I\u0026rsquo;ve known have had names I was scared to try to pronounce. And I bet \u0026ldquo;Jones\u0026rdquo; was every bit as strange to them. Especially when it is floating on a whipped cream layer of Southern drawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop us collectively from getting good things done, and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop you, either. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna have to figure this out if we\u0026rsquo;re going to eventually get the Star Trek thing down in real life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-dont-think-listen\"\u003e5) Don\u0026rsquo;t Think, Listen\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s cool that you\u0026rsquo;re a 43rd Degree Black Belt Funjitsu Bongo Engineer. Good on you. But you aren\u0026rsquo;t the bongo engineer of \u003cem\u003ethese\u003c/em\u003e bongos, and that\u0026rsquo;s what makes the difference.

You want to be helpful as possible to your own solution. It makes sense in theory, and usually falls flat in delivery. Again, I\u0026rsquo;ve been that idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you want to be helpful, sometimes the best thing you can do is to just listen and answer all of the silly little questions that don\u0026rsquo;t make sense and appear to not have anything to do with anything. They are usually more important than they sound, and in many cases, critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne irritating case that has happened on multiple occasions is when a customer has a mail issue, either they are receiving bounceback messages for spam, or their mail ends up in spam, or they are straight getting spam in mailbag quantities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ll ask for the email headers. We will send a link. Sometimes it will have pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the uninitiated, \u003cem\u003eemail headers\u003c/em\u003e are all of the extra data that is attached to each and every email that is and has been sent, ever. It\u0026rsquo;s part of the email.

We have felt misunderstood. We have said things we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have, and likely have thrown a phone or two. We\u0026rsquo;ve blamed the rep, we\u0026rsquo;ve blamed the company, we\u0026rsquo;ve pined for the \u0026ldquo;good ole days\u0026rdquo; just like you do at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are not alone.\u003c/em\u003e We understand you because we\u0026rsquo;ve been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not a global cabal of low to mid-wage personnel that simply want to drag out the call to distract them slightly from their never ending game of Microsoft Solitaire. Sure, those people \u003cem\u003edo exist\u003c/em\u003e, and it may feel that way at the time, but usually, that person you\u0026rsquo;re talking to is trying to multitask on the down low, poring through mountains of data that you should be relieved you don\u0026rsquo;t see, attempting to decipher someone else\u0026rsquo;s (usually an engineer, like me) poorly constructed explanation of a solution that only made sense to them at the time they wrote it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePro Tip: This is why I have perma-banned Mahjongg from any production workstations I use. You\u0026rsquo;d never see me again. It cures my ADHD, but cuts me off from life itself. I get a good score.

There are times when an issue for one customer is the same as one for another, they are still not identical. How systems are made up counts in how outside issues affect them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will hopefully not see much of this side of the process, and we try hard to obfuscate it to reduce your pain and suffering with the technical issue you are facing. We\u0026rsquo;ll tell you the hard, relevant facts, but some of the little things are for us to worry about, and for you to be blissfully ignorant of because there is nothing you would be able to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople worry. We worry. Everyone worries at some point. That\u0026rsquo;s part of what we exist to alleviate.

It will either get resolved just as swiftly, or it will not. When it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, there is generally a reason. Sometimes the reason isn\u0026rsquo;t a good one, but more often than not it is because there were complications in the sauce that led to a higher echelon of the company to look in and review it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile your support teams in larger companies provide 24/7/365 support, those higher groups work banker\u0026rsquo;s hours, and usually get paid banker\u0026rsquo;s bucks to do so. But they also generally have the answers or the ability to generate the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may receive more emails than you ever wanted, telling you that the process is still going on, thank you for being patient, this person did this or that, and so on. Don\u0026rsquo;t get mad. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem important, delete it and move on. You\u0026rsquo;re saving some technician\u0026rsquo;s job that is sadly required to send those messages to you in order to remain employed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are really looking at your ticket, sometimes re-checking time and again to see if they can in some way resolve the issue themselves.

Basically, we took the hardware from the component vendors, put them into a customized desktop, and businesses paid us for the desktop at a lower, more equitable price than the big box stores could offer. It was a boon for small companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, I was on the team that assembled the machines, and after a few months, the friend that got me the job managed to get me into the phone support team.

We had an irate caller that was handed to me basically to build character (mine), and not only was everyone at the end of their ropes with him, he was at the end of his rope with \u003cem\u003eus\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been shipped seven machines, one after the other, and each time they would last an hour or two and then die an ugly death due to catastrophic hard drive failure.

He couldn\u0026rsquo;t get into his laptop. The password just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. My friend, who we\u0026rsquo;ll call Terrell, tried the password, and it worked fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer demanded a new password. Then another. Then a third new one. Every password worked for Terrell, none of them worked for the customer, who increased in steaming velocity with each new iteration. Terrell asked the personality to check his Caps Lock key, which set of an explosion of profanity that we heard two aisles over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer demanded that his get his little behind in his little car and come fix the laptop at his house immediately and stop messing around because the personality had a flight in a few hours. Of course, those instructions have been softened from what he actually said for a family-friendly audience. Terrell did exactly that, because there was a contract that required it. After throwing his phone, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45 minutes driving one way later, Terrell walked in, heard more verbal abuse, and examined the laptop to see the glowing green light he fully expected to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Do you see that green light right there?\u0026rdquo; he asked the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrell punched the Caps Lock key, and the light went out.

I was feeling a bit lazy and trusting. The customer was already logged into the server, and at the time there were several hoops I had to jump through to get into it myself. He wanted to run the commands, so I accommodated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;This is not working,\u0026rdquo; he said, getting even more frustrated. He was very stressed because the service had gone down, and his boss wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop breathing down his neck. I understood what that felt like.

As an interested party in the safety of you and your organization\u0026rsquo;s email, you really need to have all three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDMARC ensures the destination email systems trust messages sent from your domain. Using DMARC with SPF and DKIM gives organizations like yours protection against spoofing and phishing emails. DMARC helps mail systems that are receiving your messages decide what to do with those nasty \u0026ldquo;messages\u0026rdquo; pretending to be from your domain that fail SPF or DKIM checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do SPF and DMARC work together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn email message can contain multiple originator or sender addresses. These addresses are used for different purposes. For example, look at these addresses:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;Mail From\u0026rdquo; address: Identifies the sender and says where to send return notices if any problems occur with the delivery of the message (such as non-delivery notices). The Mail From address appears in the envelope portion of an email message and isn\u0026rsquo;t displayed by your email application, and is sometimes called the 5321.MailFrom address or the reverse-path address.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address: The address displayed as the From address by your mail application. From address identifies the author of the email. That is, the mailbox of the person or system responsible for writing the message. The From address is sometimes called the 5322.From address.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPF uses a DNS TXT record to list the specific authorized sending IP addresses and services for a domain. Normally, SPF checks only get performed against the 5321.MailFrom address. The 5322.From address (remember, that\u0026rsquo;s the second one) isn\u0026rsquo;t authenticated when you use SPF by itself, which allows for a scenario where a user gets a message that passed SPF checks but has a spoofed 5322.From sender address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is no fun for anybody, because it\u0026rsquo;s a huge security hole in the phishing and spam realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 5321 and 5322 numbers are highly boring geek-speak referring to the Request For Comments (RFC) on these provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). If you\u0026rsquo;d like to tiptoe through the tulips of Internet pain, I leave them here for your reference:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321\"\u003eRFC 5321\u003c/a\u003e - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322\"\u003eRFC 5322\u003c/a\u003e - Internet Message Format\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me give you an example, and in this one the sender addresses are as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMail from address (5321.MailFrom): \u003ca href=\"mailto:badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\"\u003ebadguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom address (5322.From): \u003ca href=\"mailto:security@yourhappydomain.com\"\u003esecurity@yourhappydomain.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf SPF is configured, then the receiving server does a check against the Mail from address \u003ca href=\"mailto:badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\"\u003ebadguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\u003c/a\u003e. If the message came from a valid source for the domain phishing.nastyplace.com, then the SPF check passes. By \u0026ldquo;valid source\u0026rdquo;, that means that the originating server exists, not that it\u0026rsquo;s actually yours. See the problem already in progress? Since the email client only displays the From address, the user sees this message came from \u003ca href=\"mailto:security@yourhappydomain.com\"\u003esecurity@yourhappydomain.com\u003c/a\u003e. With SPF alone, the validity of yourhappydomain.com was never authenticated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we use DMARC, the receiving server will additionally perform a check against the From address. In the example above, if there\u0026rsquo;s a DMARC TXT record in place for yourhappydomain.com, then the check against the From address fails because the \u0026ldquo;Mail from\u0026rdquo; is a mismatch against the legitimate domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat deceptive email is bounced or quarantined, and the crisis you never knew you had is diverted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we\u0026rsquo;ve set up SPF and DMARC, we need to set up DKIM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDKIM lets you add a digital signature to email messages in the message header that certify the message in fact originated from your mail server and nowhere else. It\u0026rsquo;s a security measure for your domain specifically, similar to a house or car key, except more cryptographic and messier looking. If you don\u0026rsquo;t set up DKIM and instead allow the mail server to use their default DKIM configuration for your domain, DMARC may fail. This failure can happen because the default DKIM configuration will use the standard nexcess.net domain as the 5321.MailFrom address, not your specific domain.

The work day wasn\u0026rsquo;t a world on fire with people that were there to simply watch it all burn down, since that was the most entertaining thing to do, and you could actually get paid for it. Instead, every day was a tactical adventure with a real IT purpose and mission to be accomplished. You got to meet people you would never otherwise see. Pretty girls that would not otherwise give you the time of day would treat you like a celebrity and have an honest conversation with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were the waning days of Token Ring, and the advent of Ethernet, when in a networking sense we were still banging stones together to see if they\u0026rsquo;d spark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d just finished a job with a telecom company that had been purchased after I\u0026rsquo;d set up their intranet, introduced them to RedHat, and developed a website for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s a different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new position was one that I was very excited about. A rather large insurance company had bought five other insurance companies over the previous years and made the move into a high-rise in a lovely wooded area just north of a major city. Needless to say, this had made them even bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue I was hired to help resolve was to upgrade all of the antiquated technology where it could be found and connect those systems into our new network. I was a newly-minted CNE (Certified NetWare Engineer), and they had older servers to upgrade, and now five networks to splice together in one building, under one umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was right up my alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor months, everything went according to plan, some early mornings, some late nights, a few overnights from time to time. One of the transfers landed me a mini-VAX that they were going to trash, so they put it next to the dumpster, and off I drove with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been partnered with a fellow we\u0026rsquo;ll call Harry, who had actually been working for the company, and in the process of things I imagine had been let go and brought back for more money as a contractor. He was much more versed in their Windows NT setup than I was and could have been, so we joined forces. With that, I brought the gift of IntraNetWare 4.11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntraNetWare 4.11 had a nice feature of combining all of your login connections together. Previously, one had to login to NT first, then make the connection to NetWare, and I was snotty enough to think the whole darned thing was aesthetically horrid. 4.11 was cleaner, prettier, and did everything more easily for us on the backend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was these technologies that led Harry and I in our quest for more firepower, and of course, we got the approval in four memory chips, two for each of our domain controllers that would almost triple the amount of memory on those machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had everything scheduled, and the morning of the upgrade had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a blissful morning. I had my Starbucks quad-shot Venti Mocha in my custom cup, four pristine SIMM chips, and a willingness to succeed. I was going to get a jump on the day and knock this puppy out for the good of the company. My intentions were as pure as the driven snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce in the data center, wrapped sufficiently in my fleece hoodie, I located the primary and secondary domain controller boxes, pulled them off the rack and moved them to our workbench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original plan was that Harry would meet me in the datacenter, we would upgrade them both and put them back in operation in record time. We thought we had it all planned down to the heroic second.  But once I got to my desk, an hour or so early, I might add, I had a voice message that Harry would be a little late coming in. A willingness to give him less to do, and a desire to have speed from the higher-powered servers was what propelled me to the position at the workbench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the two machines, inserted the memory chips, and powered them back on again. I waited for the familiar Windows NT bootup screen, but instead was looking at a black console screen asking me to enter a code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never looked like that before. I was confuddled. Harry passed by the window on the way to his desk, looking like he\u0026rsquo;d been caught in a whirlwind, trying to fix his hair. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t awake yet, and gave a half-hearted wave as he ambled towards his cubicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried a few more things I thought might be codes, but none of them worked. I called Harry, who did not feel like talking through what was likely a hangover from Hellraiser. I quickly explained the situation that he was sleep-listening to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You have the SIMMs, yeah?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re in the machines already,\u0026rdquo; I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, ask the HP Rep what\u0026rsquo;s going on. He knows more than I do.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Who?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The HP guy.

Why would I have a guy from HP here?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sucked in his breath sharply over the phone and then moaned, \u0026ldquo;Oh, shit. No, no, no\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry was now fully awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We forgot to call them for service yesterday.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Explain. I\u0026rsquo;m not understanding,\u0026rdquo; I responded, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You cracked both boxes open at the same time, didn\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, yes. I know how to replace memory.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You do them one at a time, not at the \u003cem\u003esame\u003c/em\u003e time! Those are different, they\u0026rsquo;re under contract. I shoulda told you about that, but I assumed you knew. You have to have an HP Technician on site to enter a code if the server is physically opened. Otherwise, it won\u0026rsquo;t boot. That\u0026rsquo;s probably the error you\u0026rsquo;re seeing. This is not good. We\u0026rsquo;re locked out. We can\u0026rsquo;t bring those servers back up. I gotta call them right now!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up, and I began to mentally calculate what I thought was going to happen. The box I had been working on was the Primary Domain Controller, and the machine next to it, in identical state, was the Secondary Domain Controller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you know, you know what level of Hell we were on at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why I was an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that is precisely the point I realized what I had actually done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Primary \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the Secondary domain controllers down, there was no network access. No one could get to any of their applications, email, or anything else because I was looking at the two dead machines that handled all of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, friends, was the single point of failure. For a national company that had offices in all 50 US states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a company that in a few short hours had planned a meeting with multi-million dollar potential clients who had flown in from out of town, headed by a vice president that could not get to her presentation, her notes, her email.

I knew that the two should never come down at the same time, but was not thinking about it at the time. Over 25 years later, this still remains the dumbest mistake I ever made on duty. Thank goodness I never fell for \u003ccode\u003esudo rm -rf /\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9 AM came and went, and the calls hit like a party line. It was explained that yes, there was a hardware issue, and yes, HP was coming to fix it. He appeared around 11 AM, waltzed in with a smirk and said, \u0026ldquo;This is a helluva way to get hazed,\u0026rdquo; tapped the code into each machine and left. The whole process happened in less than ten minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had an impromptu meeting after lunch. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t invited, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t unusual. His silence afterward was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny math I had going on in my head was solved the next morning when I saw the cardboard boxes in my cubicle and a cart nearby. A security guard I was friends with stood by with an irritated look on his face as the boss from my contracting company that I had only seen twice informed me that my services were no longer required. He handed me my final check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t upset. I might have been in most circumstances, but I knew something that they didn\u0026rsquo;t know yet. The security guard escorted me out, and the irritation turned out to be against them, not me. \u0026ldquo;This is just stupid,\u0026rdquo; he said, shaking his head. \u0026ldquo;It just seems wrong to me.
