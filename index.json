[{"content":"\u003c!-- an article about mistakes and how they can be made by anyone. Forgive them. --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the worst things that can be done in the world of technology, or cooking, for that matter, is to assume. Assumptions have the quality of not being factual or concrete, while having the strange qualities of seeming so. As my 10th grade math teacher stated on the first day of class:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Never \u003cem\u003eassume\u003c/em\u003e. Because when you assume, you make an \u003cem\u003eass\u003c/em\u003e out of U and Me.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve carried that mantra with me for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow the logic trail with me and if you use your \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(Star_Trek)\"\u003eVulcan\u003c/a\u003e tendencies, you can think this out without getting angry about it and missing the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCustomers lie.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEveryone (yes, even me) is a customer,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThus, everybody lies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt my first real technical job in 1995, I worked for a major computer hardware value added reseller. Basically, we took the hardware from the component vendors, put them into a customized desktop, and businesses paid us for the desktop at a lower, more equitable price than the big box stores could offer. It was a boon for small companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, I was on the team that assembled the machines, and after a few months, the friend that got me the job managed to get me into the phone support team. I can opine on that process another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve got stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day I arrived at a specific problem. We had an irate caller that was handed to me basically to build character (mine), and not only was everyone at the end of their ropes with him, he was at the end of his rope with \u003cem\u003eus\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been shipped seven machines, one after the other, and each time they would last an hour or two and then die an ugly death due to catastrophic hard drive failure. Back then, kids, hard drives were a case about the size of a deck of tarot cards, and contained three to five metal disks that spun and held data in a manner that was electromagnetically fragile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no sense that these disks kept failing, but he would return the machine for a new one, and when we inspected the machine, everything would be fine except for the drive. After the second one, we just replaced the drive and sent the same machine back. On this latest effort, we walked and physically observed the shipping because pretty much everyone had been challenged and yelled at over this situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was only this fellow that had this problem, and that made no sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that the desktop he would inevitably be calling about was a sound, working machine because I had personally built and tested it myself, as if it were my own computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe box had passed every diagnostic, given me the beautiful Windows 95 startup screen and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been more satisfied with it. I was honestly surprised that we had let him do this seven times, which is either the beginning of a Disney movie, or a good round of social engineering on his part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis call was bound to come, because it had happened almost like clockwork before, and as expected, within a day of receipt, we received a request for return due to a defective hard drive, and angry choice words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the call was routed to me from his sales representative that sounded on the verge of tears and a mental breakdown. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about to drop his basket, he had the tone of a man about to spike it with the fury of an NFL end zone celebration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone call began as normally as it could, and after a few minutes of zippy conversation that might have resembled a 50\u0026rsquo;s television bedside manner, my customer was in good spirits. No sense in pulling the Gregory House mode on the customer out of the gate. That\u0026rsquo;s itching for a rumble, Outsiders style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You people sent me another bum computer,\u0026rdquo; he started off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;So I heard,\u0026rdquo; I responded, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can\u0026rsquo;t figure out what\u0026rsquo;s going on here. I built that machine myself, so I know for a fact it was good when it left here. Walk me through what happened.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I got the computer, brought it in here, put it on my desk, and it booted right up. I got everything set up, situated all my stuff, and then the drive was gone. This happens every time. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of jokes you folks like playing on your customers, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s very funny.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Humor me. Let\u0026rsquo;s open it up and check the jumpers and cables on the motherboard.

Let\u0026rsquo;s break into it.\u0026rdquo; I heard him fumbling around, papers and items being shuffled around his desk, and the light weighted clacking of what sounded like the screwdriver. Then I heard the clunk of a thud that just didn\u0026rsquo;t fit. It had the sound of a brick being dropped on a tabletop. It was a bit rough for the computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What was that sound?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh, that was my airplane magnet.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Your what?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;My airplane magnet. Got it off a small commuter a few years ago when I worked at the airport. Thing\u0026rsquo;s pretty handy. I keep the airplane magnet on there to hold my password sheet and invoices. I used to have something else here before I started with this computer nonsense. But if I\u0026rsquo;m gonna break into this thing, I gotta take it off.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wait, so you have that thing on the side of your computer? Like, literally attached to it?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The computer\u0026rsquo;s metal.

I have witnesses. That eighth drive was the last one, and we never heard from him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA decade later, I was working in a different segment of the tech industry, with much more experience under my belt, and I had a friend in the department adjacent that provided desktop and general IT support for a media company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had received a call from one of the prominent on-air personalities who was more than a little huffy. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t get into his laptop. The password just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. My friend, who we\u0026rsquo;ll call Terrell, tried the password, and it worked fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer demanded a new password. Then another. Then a third new one. Every password worked for Terrell, none of them worked for the customer, who increased in steaming velocity with each new iteration. Terrell asked the personality to check his Caps Lock key, which set of an explosion of profanity that we heard two aisles over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer demanded that his get his little behind in his little car and come fix the laptop at his house immediately and stop messing around because the personality had a flight in a few hours. Of course, those instructions have been softened from what he actually said for a family-friendly audience. Terrell did exactly that, because there was a contract that required it. After throwing his phone, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45 minutes driving one way later, Terrell walked in, heard more verbal abuse, and examined the laptop to see the glowing green light he fully expected to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Do you see that green light right there?\u0026rdquo; he asked the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrell punched the Caps Lock key, and the light went out. The customer cocked his head like the RCA Dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The power light\u0026rsquo;s off,\u0026rdquo; he told Terrell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the Caps Lock key,\u0026rdquo; Terrell informed him, and handing him a sticky note with the password said, \u0026ldquo;Type that in and let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer was logged in immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh, wow. I\u0026rsquo;m in.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;And now we know what a Caps Lock key does.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer at no time apologized for his mistake, or the cursing, or the 90 minutes of driving time Terrell had to make on his own dime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrell quit the following week. I still can\u0026rsquo;t stand to see that guy on TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few years later, I was working in a high-rise. I\u0026rsquo;ve written before about my former love of high-rise buildings. I had been given a new laptop, partially against my will and this was during the beginnings of the WiFi age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get the wifi adapter to register or connect to anything for life, love, or money. So I did what most would do, and called my IT Desktop Support, who happened to be a personal friend as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to explain what to do, and I guess I simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t listening. Nothing he was saying was making sense. I\u0026rsquo;d been a network engineer, for goodness sake. I should have been telling \u003cem\u003ehim\u003c/em\u003e how to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll send you the manual in your email. Look at it. It\u0026rsquo;ll make sense.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped through quickly, being frustrated, not paying attention. I called him back. He was not pleased. This was becoming less like a normal day at work, and more like an episode of Thomas the Tank Engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m coming over,\u0026rdquo; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few moments, he appeared in my cubicle. \u0026ldquo;Pop open that PDF,\u0026rdquo; he commanded. \u0026ldquo;I \u003cem\u003ehighlighted\u003c/em\u003e the part you needed to see.

I had missed it because I had incorrectly assumed (there\u0026rsquo;s that word again) that it was for the laptop battery lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Pull that slider towards you, jackass,\u0026rdquo; he ordered with a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, the listing of available networks popped alive on screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; he intoned with his best Ben Stein impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I apologize,\u0026rdquo; I told him in force-fed humility, \u0026ldquo;I got that \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e wrong.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You owe me a Coke.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I owe you two Cokes,\u0026rdquo; I told him, \u0026ldquo;One for making it right, and another for being an ass.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Sold.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never made that mistake again, and learned to double check before I get mad at support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also had a situation when I was on the phone with a customer. I was feeling a bit lazy and trusting. The customer was already logged into the server, and at the time there were several hoops I had to jump through to get into it myself. He wanted to run the commands, so I accommodated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;This is not working,\u0026rdquo; he said, getting even more frustrated. He was very stressed because the service had gone down, and his boss wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop breathing down his neck. I understood what that felt like. I did not, however, understand why my command wasn\u0026rsquo;t working as it was one I executed several times every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I proceeded to log in myself, I contacted my usual sanity check person and explained the conundrum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Look at it yourself,\u0026rdquo; he advised, \u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003eThe first rule of tech support is that the customer lies\u003c/em\u003e.

As an interested party in the safety of you and your organization\u0026rsquo;s email, you really need to have all three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDMARC ensures the destination email systems trust messages sent from your domain. Using DMARC with SPF and DKIM gives organizations like yours protection against spoofing and phishing emails. DMARC helps mail systems that are receiving your messages decide what to do with those nasty \u0026ldquo;messages\u0026rdquo; pretending to be from your domain that fail SPF or DKIM checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do SPF and DMARC work together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn email message can contain multiple originator or sender addresses. These addresses are used for different purposes. For example, look at these addresses:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;Mail From\u0026rdquo; address: Identifies the sender and says where to send return notices if any problems occur with the delivery of the message (such as non-delivery notices). The Mail From address appears in the envelope portion of an email message and isn\u0026rsquo;t displayed by your email application, and is sometimes called the 5321.MailFrom address or the reverse-path address.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address: The address displayed as the From address by your mail application. From address identifies the author of the email. That is, the mailbox of the person or system responsible for writing the message. The From address is sometimes called the 5322.From address.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPF uses a DNS TXT record to list the specific authorized sending IP addresses and services for a domain. Normally, SPF checks only get performed against the 5321.MailFrom address. The 5322.From address (remember, that\u0026rsquo;s the second one) isn\u0026rsquo;t authenticated when you use SPF by itself, which allows for a scenario where a user gets a message that passed SPF checks but has a spoofed 5322.From sender address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is no fun for anybody, because it\u0026rsquo;s a huge security hole in the phishing and spam realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 5321 and 5322 numbers are highly boring geek-speak referring to the Request For Comments (RFC) on these provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). If you\u0026rsquo;d like to tiptoe through the tulips of Internet pain, I leave them here for your reference:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321\"\u003eRFC 5321\u003c/a\u003e - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322\"\u003eRFC 5322\u003c/a\u003e - Internet Message Format\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me give you an example, and in this one the sender addresses are as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMail from address (5321.MailFrom): \u003ca href=\"mailto:badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\"\u003ebadguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom address (5322.From): \u003ca href=\"mailto:security@yourhappydomain.com\"\u003esecurity@yourhappydomain.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf SPF is configured, then the receiving server does a check against the Mail from address \u003ca href=\"mailto:badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\"\u003ebadguy@phishing.nastyplace.com\u003c/a\u003e. If the message came from a valid source for the domain phishing.nastyplace.com, then the SPF check passes. By \u0026ldquo;valid source\u0026rdquo;, that means that the originating server exists, not that it\u0026rsquo;s actually yours. See the problem already in progress? Since the email client only displays the From address, the user sees this message came from \u003ca href=\"mailto:security@yourhappydomain.com\"\u003esecurity@yourhappydomain.com\u003c/a\u003e. With SPF alone, the validity of yourhappydomain.com was never authenticated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we use DMARC, the receiving server will additionally perform a check against the From address. In the example above, if there\u0026rsquo;s a DMARC TXT record in place for yourhappydomain.com, then the check against the From address fails because the \u0026ldquo;Mail from\u0026rdquo; is a mismatch against the legitimate domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat deceptive email is bounced or quarantined, and the crisis you never knew you had is diverted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we\u0026rsquo;ve set up SPF and DMARC, we need to set up DKIM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDKIM lets you add a digital signature to email messages in the message header that certify the message in fact originated from your mail server and nowhere else. It\u0026rsquo;s a security measure for your domain specifically, similar to a house or car key, except more cryptographic and messier looking. If you don\u0026rsquo;t set up DKIM and instead allow the mail server to use their default DKIM configuration for your domain, DMARC may fail. This failure can happen because the default DKIM configuration will use the standard nexcess.net domain as the 5321.MailFrom address, not your specific domain. This creates a mismatch between the 5321.MailFrom and the 5322.From addresses in all the email sent from your domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other hairs we could split here that include third-party services like Microsoft and GMail, but this is meant to provide an overview of these three records and why they must be intentionally and correctly implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you ever have a need to verify these settings for yourself, or for another domain, I use the following site to check and generate these settings in a simple, yet effective manner:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dmarcly.com/tools/\"\u003eDMARCLY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also have a little tool that will check all of these settings at the command line for you.

The work day wasn\u0026rsquo;t a world on fire with people that were there to simply watch it all burn down, since that was the most entertaining thing to do, and you could actually get paid for it. Instead, every day was a tactical adventure with a real IT purpose and mission to be accomplished. You got to meet people you would never otherwise see. Pretty girls that would not otherwise give you the time of day would treat you like a celebrity and have an honest conversation with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were the waning days of Token Ring, and the advent of Ethernet, when in a networking sense we were still banging stones together to see if they\u0026rsquo;d spark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d just finished a job with a telecom company that had been purchased after I\u0026rsquo;d set up their intranet, introduced them to RedHat, and developed a website for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s a different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new position was one that I was very excited about. A rather large insurance company had bought five other insurance companies over the previous years and made the move into a high-rise in a lovely wooded area just north of a major city. Needless to say, this had made them even bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue I was hired to help resolve was to upgrade all of the antiquated technology where it could be found and connect those systems into our new network. I was a newly-minted CNE (Certified NetWare Engineer), and they had older servers to upgrade, and now five networks to splice together in one building, under one umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was right up my alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor months, everything went according to plan, some early mornings, some late nights, a few overnights from time to time. One of the transfers landed me a mini-VAX that they were going to trash, so they put it next to the dumpster, and off I drove with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been partnered with a fellow we\u0026rsquo;ll call Harry, who had actually been working for the company, and in the process of things I imagine had been let go and brought back for more money as a contractor. He was much more versed in their Windows NT setup than I was and could have been, so we joined forces. With that, I brought the gift of IntraNetWare 4.11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntraNetWare 4.11 had a nice feature of combining all of your login connections together. Previously, one had to login to NT first, then make the connection to NetWare, and I was snotty enough to think the whole darned thing was aesthetically horrid. 4.11 was cleaner, prettier, and did everything more easily for us on the backend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was these technologies that led Harry and I in our quest for more firepower, and of course, we got the approval in four memory chips, two for each of our domain controllers that would almost triple the amount of memory on those machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had everything scheduled, and the morning of the upgrade had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a blissful morning. I had my Starbucks quad-shot Venti Mocha in my custom cup, four pristine SIMM chips, and a willingness to succeed. I was going to get a jump on the day and knock this puppy out for the good of the company. My intentions were as pure as the driven snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce in the data center, wrapped sufficiently in my fleece hoodie, I located the primary and secondary domain controller boxes, pulled them off the rack and moved them to our workbench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original plan was that Harry would meet me in the datacenter, we would upgrade them both and put them back in operation in record time. We thought we had it all planned down to the heroic second.  But once I got to my desk, an hour or so early, I might add, I had a voice message that Harry would be a little late coming in. A willingness to give him less to do, and a desire to have speed from the higher-powered servers was what propelled me to the position at the workbench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the two machines, inserted the memory chips, and powered them back on again. I waited for the familiar Windows NT bootup screen, but instead was looking at a black console screen asking me to enter a code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never looked like that before. I was confuddled. Harry passed by the window on the way to his desk, looking like he\u0026rsquo;d been caught in a whirlwind, trying to fix his hair. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t awake yet, and gave a half-hearted wave as he ambled towards his cubicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried a few more things I thought might be codes, but none of them worked. I called Harry, who did not feel like talking through what was likely a hangover from Hellraiser. I quickly explained the situation that he was sleep-listening to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You have the SIMMs, yeah?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re in the machines already,\u0026rdquo; I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, ask the HP Rep what\u0026rsquo;s going on. He knows more than I do.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Who?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The HP guy.

Why would I have a guy from HP here?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sucked in his breath sharply over the phone and then moaned, \u0026ldquo;Oh, shit. No, no, no\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry was now fully awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We forgot to call them for service yesterday.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Explain. I\u0026rsquo;m not understanding,\u0026rdquo; I responded, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You cracked both boxes open at the same time, didn\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, yes. I know how to replace memory.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You do them one at a time, not at the \u003cem\u003esame\u003c/em\u003e time! Those are different, they\u0026rsquo;re under contract. I shoulda told you about that, but I assumed you knew. You have to have an HP Technician on site to enter a code if the server is physically opened. Otherwise, it won\u0026rsquo;t boot. That\u0026rsquo;s probably the error you\u0026rsquo;re seeing. This is not good. We\u0026rsquo;re locked out. We can\u0026rsquo;t bring those servers back up. I gotta call them right now!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up, and I began to mentally calculate what I thought was going to happen. The box I had been working on was the Primary Domain Controller, and the machine next to it, in identical state, was the Secondary Domain Controller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you know, you know what level of Hell we were on at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why I was an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that is precisely the point I realized what I had actually done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Primary \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the Secondary domain controllers down, there was no network access. No one could get to any of their applications, email, or anything else because I was looking at the two dead machines that handled all of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, friends, was the single point of failure. For a national company that had offices in all 50 US states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a company that in a few short hours had planned a meeting with multi-million dollar potential clients who had flown in from out of town, headed by a vice president that could not get to her presentation, her notes, her email.

I knew that the two should never come down at the same time, but was not thinking about it at the time. Over 25 years later, this still remains the dumbest mistake I ever made on duty. Thank goodness I never fell for \u003ccode\u003esudo rm -rf /\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9 AM came and went, and the calls hit like a party line. It was explained that yes, there was a hardware issue, and yes, HP was coming to fix it. He appeared around 11 AM, waltzed in with a smirk and said, \u0026ldquo;This is a helluva way to get hazed,\u0026rdquo; tapped the code into each machine and left. The whole process happened in less than ten minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had an impromptu meeting after lunch. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t invited, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t unusual. His silence afterward was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny math I had going on in my head was solved the next morning when I saw the cardboard boxes in my cubicle and a cart nearby. A security guard I was friends with stood by with an irritated look on his face as the boss from my contracting company that I had only seen twice informed me that my services were no longer required. He handed me my final check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t upset.
